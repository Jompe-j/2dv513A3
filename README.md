# App to perform DB calls for course 2dv513 - Linneaus university

A Kotlin application to test some basic DB querise for a course in DB. The application used a dataset from yelp. 

General guidelines for the queries were that tt least 2 queries should query data from more than one table. An SQL JOIN had to be made and that Aggregation and/or grouping should be used. 

## My own thoughts
This application was written as simple as possible and the focus was on getting the DB queries and report done in time. But it did offer me some first hand experience with Kotlin.
